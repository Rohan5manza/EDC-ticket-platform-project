The urls.py file defines the URL routes for the ticketing platform. The login, register, free-ticket, buy-ticket, and logout routes are used to handle user authentication, ticket requests, and logging out.

The views.py file defines the view functions for each URL route. These functions interact with the models and forms to handle user requests and return appropriate responses.

The forms.py file defines the form classes used to render the various forms on the ticketing platform. There are three form classes defined: FreeTicketForm, BuyTicketForm, and TicketForm.

The models.py file defines the Ticket model which is used to store ticket information in the database. The model has fields for the ticket code, name, and email.

The templates directory contains the HTML templates used to render the pages on the ticketing platform. There are templates for the base layout, login page, registration page, ticket confirmation page, and error pages.

The ticket code generation is implemented using the get_random_string() function from Django's django.utils.crypto module. A new code is generated every time a Ticket object is saved if one has not been provided.

When a user requests a free ticket, a new Ticket object is created and saved to the database with their email address. The user is then redirected to a page that displays their ticket code.

When a user requests to buy a ticket, their name and email address are submitted via a form. After submitting the form, a new Ticket object is created and saved to the database with their name and email address. The user is then redirected to a page that displays their ticket code.

When a user logs in or registers, they are redirected to the homepage where they can request a free ticket or buy a ticket.

When a user logs out, they are redirected to the login page.

When a user submits a form with invalid data, they are redirected to a page that displays the errors.
